********************************


Property owners and managers pay us a monthly per-unit subscription to manage listings, agreements, rent tracking, and maintenance in one place.
They pay because it reduces vacancies, late payments, and operational chaos.
Pricing is per unit, billed monthly or annually, and scales as their portfolio grows.”
